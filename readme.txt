REQUIREMENTS:

What you need to run this on a separate server is basically nothing! You just need Django installed, pip, and a python package called django-countries.

INSTALLATION:

1. Open up the project folder in command prompt. Create a virtual environment.
2. If you don't have pip installed do so through the command prompt
3. Install django-countries into your virtual environment by using 'pip install django-countries'
4. Run the server by typing 'python manage.py runserver'
5. Head to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ for the home page and go from there!
